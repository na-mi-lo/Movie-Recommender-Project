Q/A: 9
Notes:
  - introduced selves, TOC slide
  - text size reasonable, slides a little text heavy
  - reasonable volume+clarity
    - but tendency to look at slides rather than audience sometimes hinders this
  - some slides go past fast enough we don't really have time to read everything
  - can't really read some figures (e.g. learning curve for ANN)
  - lots of time spent on describing learning algorithms (even though they're
    just standard basic ones)
  - can't read text on many figures in results (e.g. scatter plots, confusion mat, etc.)
  - different methods have results presented in very different formats, makes comparison difficult
  - some transitions unclear; at times it seems sort of like 4 different mini-projects that got stuck together

Q/A: 9
Notes:
  - speech is audible, but a bit on the quiet side for the space (especially Jaden)
  - try not to talk to the screen
  - good call on inflation adjustment
  - some slides are rather text heavy (e.g. neural net slide, logistic regression slide)
  - most slide text is a readable size, but text in figures is often too small (e.g. loss curve figure, 'initial relationships')
  - blue on black isn't great contrast
  - too much time spent explaining how basic methods work (we all know how KNN and random forests work by now)
  - try to repeat questions for audience before answering, and answer for the whole group, not just the person who asked
