# Timeline
* upload your proposal to this directory as proposal.pdf
* edit this README file to include your timeline.  Fill in the **We plan to accomplish** section for each week with specific steps you plan to have completed by the lab meeting that week.

Each week, for the checkpoint you need to fill out by **Monday Night** (so I have a day to read it before lab):
* Which of the goals have you accomplished
* For the goals you did not accomplish, state the issue/problem that is blocking progress
* Any questions you have.  This can help us prepare for the lab meeting.
* Update your timeline/goals for the following week if needed

-------
## Week 1 Planning

### Goals ###
This is what you plan to accomplish in the first week of the project, leading up
to our lab meeting.  You must fill this in as part of your proposal.
* Hand in the full proposal
* Task/Goal 1: Start Playing with the different algorithms
* Task/Goal 2: Download and store movie list data file 
* Task/Goal 3: Determine which weights of which features affects the data more 

### Update ###

Complete this section ahead of lab for week 1 of the project
* We handed in our proposal and created this timeline
* We have also completed ...
* We are working on creating a more detailed phased plan

### Requests ###
We need advice about/help with ... (optional): The models that we are going to be using

* Task/Goal 3: Normalize and clean up the data file
* Task/Goal 4: Implement algorithms (KNN: Opeyemi, Logistic Regression: Jayden, Lasso: Mavis, Random Forests: Natassia)

### Update ###

Complete this section ahead of lab for week 2 of the project
* We have completed Lasso Regression and Nueral Network Implementation 
* We are stuck on low accuracy with Lasso Regression and NN

### Requests ###
We need advice about/help with: what we do do about the low accuracy scores
